/**
 * <p>A geospatial database that uses a vantage point tree as its storage
 * mechanism.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Vantage point trees (or "vp-trees") are a subclass of metric trees.
 * Vantage point trees use binary space partitioning to recursively divide
 * points among their nodes. Nodes in a vantage point tree have a center point
 * and a distance threshold; points with a distance less than or equal to the
 * threshold are assigned to the "left" child of a node and the others are
 * assigned to the "right" child.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Queries in a vp-tree execute in O(log n) time in the best case, and tree
 * construction takes O(n log n) time.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Vantage point trees may optionally be constructed with a
 * {@code nodeCapacity} argument. The node capacity dictates the maximum number
 * of points that <em>should</em> be stored in any given leaf node, although
 * nodes may hold more than that many points if its contents can't be
 * partitioned (i.e. all of the points in the node are coincident).</p>
 * 
 * <p>When a search executed against a vp-tree reaches a leaf node, all of the
 * points in that node are considered for inclusion in the result set. It's
 * possible that a k-nearest-neighbor search will only need to visit one leaf
 * node if that node contains all of the k nearest neighbors to the query point.
 * A "good" node capacity for a vp-tree will be orders of magnitude smaller than
 * the size of the whole dataset and slightly larger (on the same order of
 * magnitude) than the "usual" number of nearest neighbors returned in a search;
 * a well-chosen node capacity will make searches more efficient by minimizing
 * the number of nodes that need to be visited while still minimizing the number
 * of "bad" points considered.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The default node capacity for a vp-tree is {@value DEFAULT_BIN_SIZE}
 * points.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that the {@code VPTree} class is <strong>not</strong> thread-safe;
 * because they forego any kind of synchronization or locking, {@code VPTree}
 * instances can achieve slightly higher search throughput than their
 * thread-safe counterparts. This makes the {@code VPTree} class a good choice
 * for single-threaded applications or applications where the tree will not be
 * modified after construction.

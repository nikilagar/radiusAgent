/**
 * <p>The {@code SearchResults} class is a fixed-size {@link PriorityQueue}
 * subclass that may or may not accept points that are offered to it based on
 * several criteria. {@code SearchResults} instances are always created with a
 * reference to a query point and a prescribed size; when points are offered via
 * the {@link SearchResults#add} or {@link SearchResults#addAll} methods, the
 * {@code SearchResults} instance will accept the point if and only if the
 * following conditions are met:</p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>The {@code SearchResults} instance contains fewer points than its
 * maximum capacity <em>or</em> the offered point is closer to the query point
 * than the most distant point already in the queue.</li>
 * <li>No maximum distance has been specified or the offered point falls within
 * the maximum allowable distance from the query point.</li>
 * <li>No search criteria have been specified or the offered point meets the
 * given search criteria.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>{@code SearchResults} objects use an internal reverse geospatial distance
 * comparator; this ensures that the point at the head of the queue is always
 * the most distant point from the query point.</p>
